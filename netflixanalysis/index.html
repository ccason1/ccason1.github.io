	<h3>Questions and Hypotheses</h3>
	<p>Question: is there a correlation between genre and IMDB score?</p>
  <p>Question: is there a correlation between IMDB score and runtime?</p>
  <p>Hypothesis: the average IMDB score is significantly above 5</p>

	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	
	<h4>Correlation between genre and IMDB score</h4>
	<p>
	   There does appear to be some correlation between genre and IMDB score. 
	   For example, documentaries got an average score of approximately 6.9 out of 10, 
		 whereas thrillers only got around 5.6 out of 10.
  </p>
  
	<h4>Correlation between IMDB score and runtime</h4>
	<p>
	   Looking at the scatter chart, there does not appear to be a correlation 
		 between IMDB score and runtime.
	</p>
  
	<h4>Is average IMDB score above 5</h4>
	<p>
	   My hypothesis that the average IMDB score is significantly above
		 5 appears to be correct. The reasoning behind the hypothesis is
		 that people tend to watch films that they are interested in, and
		 have a better chance of scoring higher than if they only watched
		 films that they weren't interested in. However, the actual reason
		 behind the correlation could be different. For example, maybe
		 Netflix originals have a better reception than non-Netflix originals.
	</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Methods</h3>
	
	<h4>Correlation between genre and IMDB score</h4>
	<p>
	   To find out whether or not there is a correlation between genre and
	   IMDB score, I wrote a <a href="genre_rating_analysis.html" target="_blank">Python script</a> 
		 that analyzes a dataset containing
		 a list of films, with a genre and IMDB score associated with each film.
		 From this data, I created a dictionary of genres, with each genre having
		 an associated list of IMDB scores. I eliminated genres containing too 
		 few films associated with them in order to simplify the data and make
		 it more understandable. I think this elimination process is fair
		 because whether I use a hundred genres or five does not change the
		 conclusion or obscure any essential facts. From there I created a
		 new dictionary with each list of scores averaged into single scores
		 for each genre. After that I used plotly to generate a bar chart to
		 visualize the data.

		 <h4>Correlation between IMDB score and runtime</h4>
		 <p>
		    To answer the second question, "Is there a correlation between IMDB
				score and runtime?" I generated a <a href="scatterchart.html" target="_blank">Scatter Chart</a> using plotly
				in a <a href="rating_to_runtime.html" target="_blank">Python script</a>. 
				From a purely visual analysis, I can see no correlation.
		 </p>
     
		 <h4>Is average IMDB score above 5</h4>
		 <p>
		    To find a conclusion to the claim, "The average IMDB score is significantly
				above 5," I created a <a href="ratings_analysis.html" target="_blank">Python script</a>
				to analyze the IMDB scores. The
				average score turns out to be approximately 6.3, with a 99% confidence
				interval of (6.17, 6.38)--which means we are 99% confident that the true
				average IMDB score of Netflix Originals is between these two values.
