		You are standing in a room full of strange lab equipment. A mysterious beeping sound emanates from nowhere in particular. Among the scientists scattered around the room, a familiar face catches your eye.
		<br><br>
		Yukov, an old friend of yours, notices you. He approaches and puts his arm around your shoulder, then leads you to a countertop in the corner of the room. Glancing over his shoulder, he pulls a volumetric flask full of clear liquid from a cabinet, along with two small shotglass-sized beakers.
		<br><br>
		"My friend, it's good to see you."
		<br><br>
		He pops a rubber cork off the flask and pours a small amout of liquid into the beakers. By a whiff of the smell you can plainly tell it's high-proof grain ethanol. He lifts the beaker in cheers and waits for you to do the same.
