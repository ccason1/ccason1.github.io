	<h1>What is the Difference Between a Function and an Algorithm?</h1>
	<h2>Author: Conlan Cason
	
	<p>
	  Okay first of all, what the heck is a function? What in the blazes is an algorithm? 
	  You may have learned about functions already, in which case this is just a refresher. 
	  But if you already know what an algorithm is then you might as well be the teacher.
